# CameraxTFLite
my exercise to use Android CameraX and TFLite codegen in Kotlin

To test [TFLite metadata](https://www.tensorflow.org/lite/convert/metadata) and [codegen](https://www.tensorflow.org/lite/guide/codegen), I need an Android app that can grab camera inputs and convert them into [Android Bitmap](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/graphics/Bitmap) to feed into the generated model wrapper. Since I know nothing about Android Camera and Kotlin, I started this from the [CameraX tutorial](https://codelabs.developers.google.com/codelabs/camerax-getting-started/). It seems quite easy.
